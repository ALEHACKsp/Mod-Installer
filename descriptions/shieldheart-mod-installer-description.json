			"releaseDate": "2018-03-25",
			"description": "Relentless Night is a gameplay mod for The Long Dark that introduces a new sandbox scenario where the spin of the Earth is slowing down. Slowly but surely, days and nights are getting longer over time, leading to a world with continuously changing temperatures, weather patterns, wildlife populations, and more.",

			"changes": "- (new) All mod gameplay features can now be customized or turned off individually through the custom game setup menu.\n- (new) Indoor environments will retain heat from fires much longer after the fire has burnt out. The hotter the fire, the longer it will keep the place warm. In enclosed buildings, fires will heat the whole house/space and better insulated environments will keep warm for longer.\n- (new) Temperature will now affect wildlife populations. Roaming wildlife will be less abundant and harder to find in extreme cold temperatures, but also more abundant in relatively warm temperatures.\n- (new) You can now adjust how long fuels will burn in a fire or how long lantern fuel will last while in use. All can be adjusted to provide up to 3 times their regular burn times.\n- (new) Fixed bug in vanilla game where loot inside of containers in custom games would generate incorrectly, causing things [like this](). The correct amount of loot will now generate for the associated difficulty chosen in custom mode.\n- (new) Fixed bug in vanilla game that prevented custom mode option \"Wake Up When Freezing\" from working. This feature is now functional and enabled in all Relentless Night games.\n- Days and nights get increasingly longer eventually ending in the tidal locking of the Earth and survival in perpetual darkness.\n- Temperatures become increasingly warmer/colder with duration of days/nights.\n- Indoor temperatures now have a slight correlation with outdoor temperature.\n- Blizzards and stronger winds become more frequent as days/nights become longer and weather becomes more extreme.\n- Roaming wildlife become increasingly scarce as outdoor conditions become more extreme and harsh.\n- Cabin fever affliction is disabled due to the eventuality of long nights and extreme outdoor temperatures.\n- Indoor environments can become slightly lit during nights depending on weather and available moonlight outdoors. During the brightest phases of the moon, crafting/breaking of items indoors can become available again.\n- Surveying is now possible at night, provided the weather is clear and enough light is present.\n- For every additional 1C below a feels-like temperature of -40C, the rate at which the player suffers freezing damage is increased. This effect can accumulate up to a maximum of 5x the original rate at a -100C feels-like temperature and below, do bring a jacket.\n- The mod scenario can be played in all sandbox difficulties and can be set up in its own sandbox page. The mod does not prevent playing regular sandbox or other vanilla modes. Relentless night saves are kept completely separate from other save data and cannot be played by regular sandbox mode and vice versa.\n- Note: Journal statistics and days survived are still tracked in regular 24-hour days, as if the player is still keeping track with a watch.\n",
